He's the man who's gonna do her right
Turn new pages
What can she see with the naked eye?
Nothing changes

That if he could, he would have been so fine
As it is they're strangers
It wasn't this that he had in mind
Being a lonesome ranger

Keep stepping outta line now
Get up, get out
Don't leave it to nature
Oh, no

A step in the light now
Get up, get out
Don't leave it to nature
Oh, no

There's a girl, she's gonna take him first
In easy stages
And every time he thinks he could be worse
It grows more contagious

This is a plan of your own contriving
It's a plan to see what you're going through
Couldn't stop your bridges burning
But don't you worry 'cause you're still learning

So when he says he's gonna do you right
Turn new pages
'Cause it isn't this that you had in mind
Being a lonesome ranger
