You make my heart feel fragile like it's made of glass
When I'm with you I melt, like fire to some plastic
With your arms around me, nothing bad could happen
I don't wanna be with nobody else
We roll around the town, just doing what we like
I wanna be with you every day and every night
I got some drugs on me, if you want, we can get real high
I remember when I used to get fucked up by myself, yeah

You got me stuck, it's all love in your eyes
And your pops don't like me, but neither do I
We gon' pull off with the top let down
Baby, pack up, we gon' leave this town
'Cause I want you, I need you
And baby girl, it's true when I say I only see you
No matter what, yeah, I swear I'll never leave you
(No matter what, yeah, I swear I'll never leave you)
No matter what, I swear I'll never leave you
(No matter what, yeah, I swear I'll never leave you)

Don't leave me alone
I need you to know, I need you to know
I'll be here for sure
My wrist might be froze but my heart won't get cold
Baby, you my rose, yeah
And I need you to grow, I need you to know
Won't leave you alone
So don't leave me alone

You light up my life like lightning
When I'm with you, everything feels less frightening
Screw everyone else cause I don't fuck with them
My money on the shelf, you know I'm getting it
I'm looking fly as hell, bet I'm spending it
Might just fly you out to chill and shit, yeah
And when I'm with you feels like when we're on drugs
Just say, are you feeling it too?
I don't wanna be without you, anything you want
Call me Gwen cause I got you, yeah, I say "no doubt, boo"
And I'm fly like Gwen, I'm looking pretty as hell
And you're pretty as hell, just wanna figure you out
Just wanna live in your shell with you
Yeah, you're pretty as hell, just wanna figure you out
Just wanna live in your shell with you

Don't leave me alone
I need you to know, I need you to know
I'll be here for sure
My wrist might be froze but my heart won't get cold
Baby, you my rose, yeah
And I need you to grow, I need you to know
Won't leave you alone
So don't leave me alone
Don't leave me alone
I need you to know, I need you to know
I'll be here for sure
My wrist might be froze but my heart won't get cold
Baby, you my rose, yeah
And I need you to grow, I need you to know
Won't leave you alone
So don't leave me alone

Don't leave me alone
Don't leave me alone
Don't leave me alone
Don't leave me alone
Don't leave me alone
Don't leave me alone
Don't leave me alone
Don't leave me alone
